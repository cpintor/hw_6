A Your program should store the correct answers shown above in a list. It should ask
the user to enter the student’s answers for each of the 20 questions, and the
answers should be stored in another list. After the student’s answers, have been
entered, the program should display a message indicating whether the student
passed or failed the exam. (A student must correctly answer 15 of the 20 questions
to pass the exam.) It should then display the total number of correctly answered
questions, the total number of incorrectly answered questions, and a list showing
the question numbers of the incorrectly answered questions.
